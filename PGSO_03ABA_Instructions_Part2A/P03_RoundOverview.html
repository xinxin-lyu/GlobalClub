	<u> Decision Task </u>
	
	<p> Everyone in your group has a Private Account and your group of four has a <mark_groupAcc> Group Account </mark_groupAcc>. </p>

	<p> In each round, you need to decide how to allocate your points between the Private Account and the  <mark_groupAcc> Group Account </mark_groupAcc>.  </p>
	
	<p> Each point in the Private Account yields a return of <strong style="color: red"> 1 point </strong> to YOU in that round. 

	<p> Each point in the Group Account yields a return of <strong style="color: red"> 0.6 point </strong> to EVERYONE in the group. 
		(Note: everyone in your group can allocate points to the <mark_groupAcc>Group Account</mark_groupAcc>.) </p>
