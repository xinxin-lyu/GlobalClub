	<u>Earnings  </u>
		<p> Your earning in each round is: 
			<center> <strong>
			1 * Number of points in your Private Account
			<br> +
			<br> 0.6 * Number of points in <mark_groupAcc>Group Account</mark_groupAcc>
			<br> + 
			<br> if you paid the fee: - {{FC}}   + 0.6 * Number of points in <mark_groupAcc2>Group Account #2</mark_groupAcc2>, 
			</strong> </center>
		</p>
		
	<p> For example, 
	{{ if HOMO }}
	if the fee is 1 point, you decide to pay the fee. 
	You will have 19 (20-1) points to allocate among the three accounts. 
	Suppose you keep 9 points in your private account and allocate 5 points each to the two group accounts.
	Suppose others allocate 20 points to the group account and 20 points in the second group account, 
	your earning in this round will be 9 + 0.6*(5+20) + 0.6*(5+20) = 9 + 0.6*25 + 0.6*25 = 39 points.
	{{ else  }}
	if the fee is 1 point, you decide to pay the fee. 
	Suppose you have 10 points as endowment, you will have 9 (10-1) points to allocate among the three accounts. 
	Suppose you keep 5 points in your private account and allocate 2 points each to the two group accounts. 
	Suppose others allocate 20 points to the group account and 20 points in the second group account, 
	your earning in this round will be 5 + 0.6*(2+20) + 0.6*(2+20) = 9 + 0.6*25 + 0.6*25 = 31.4 points.
	{{ endif }}
	</p> 	
	
	<p> At the end of each round, your earnings for the round will be recorded. 
		Your payment for part 3 will be determined by the sum of the points 
		that you earn in all three matches with a conversion rate of: {{PointsPerDollar}} points = $1. 
	</p>
		

	<u> Information </u>
	
	<p> You will be able to review both <mark_groupAcc> Group Account </mark_groupAcc> and <mark_groupAcc2>Group Account #2</mark_groupAcc2>
