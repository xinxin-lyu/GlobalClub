	<div style="position:relative;left: 10%;width: 80%;background-color: #ffffff">
	<u>Endowment </u>
	{{ if HOMO }}
	<p> At the beginning of each round, you receive 20 points and the other three participants in your group each receive 20 points. </p>
	{{ else  }}
	<p> At the beginning of each round, 
		two of your group members will receive 10 points and the other two will receive 30 points. 
		Who receives how much is randomly determined. 
		However, the endowments stay the same in this part.
		That means, if you receive 10 points in the first round,
		you will continue receiving 10 points in each round.  </p>
	{{ endif }}

	<p> You will see the endowments of the other group members you are paired with.  </p>

	<u> Decision Task </u>
	
	<p> Each round has two decision stages. </p>
	
	<p> In stage 1, you need to decide whether to pay a fee of {{FC}} points and gain access to <mark_groupAcc2> Group Account #2</mark_groupAcc2>. </p>
	
	<p> In stage 2, you will know who else paid the fee and gained the access to <mark_groupAcc2> Group Account #2</mark_groupAcc2>.
	
	<ul>
	<li> If you paid the fee, you can allocate the rest of your endowment among three accounts:
		<br> your Private Account, <mark_groupAcc> Group Account </mark_groupAcc>, and <mark_groupAcc2> Group Account #2</mark_groupAcc2>. </li>
	<li> If you didnâ€™t pay the fee, you will allocate your endowment between 
		your Private Account and the <mark_groupAcc>Group Account</mark_groupAcc> . </li>
	
	</ul>
	<p> Everyone in your group and the other group has a Private Account. 
	 Your group of four has a <mark_groupAcc> Group Account </mark_groupAcc>. 
	 Everyone in your group 
		and the other group can pay the fee and access to <mark_groupAcc2>Group Account #2</mark_groupAcc2>.</p>
	
	<p> Each point in the Private Account yields a return of <strong style="color: red"> 1 point </strong> to YOU in that round. 

	<p> Each point in the Group Account yields a return of <strong style="color: red"> 0.6 point </strong> to EVERYONE <strong>in the group</strong>. 
		(Note: everyone in your group can allocate points to the <mark_groupAcc>Group Account</mark_groupAcc>.) </p>
		
	<p> Each point in the <mark_groupAcc2>Group Account #2</mark_groupAcc2> yields a return of <strong style="color: red"> 0.6 point </strong> to EVERYONE <strong>who paid the fee</strong>. 
		(Note: everyone who paid the fee can allocate points to the <mark_groupAcc2>Group Account #2</mark_groupAcc2>.) </p>
